Doctor Octopus is a automation tool who do your toil for you and at the same time prevent you to get any RSI.

Yes, originally he is a anti hero but his utility are essentially awesome and as there is no more Tritium on planet earth we belive that now he is under control and will not get crazy again.

But don't fool yourself, if you get crazy while work with him WE WILL CALL SPIDER-MAN ON YOU!
Remember Uncle Ben.

Since this is a virtual character we add some improvements of course. 
Instead of only four arms he can use how many you like. Also he already has knowledge about some Azion's tools and will use them in order to do a better and fast work. He also is an open project among Azions and a easy use tool.

## Instalation

If you want to use on a virtual enviroment
```
virtualenv -p python 3 env
source env/bin/activate
```

For obvious reasons Doctor Octopus it's not a PyPI oficial package so you need to install directly from our Github.
```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/tiagorkrebs/doctor-octopus.git
octo -l
```
Make sure that you have an authorized private key for this.
